Welcome to Mathiaus’s System! (MS)

WORDS OF CAUTION (Skip to Step 1 if this is your first time installing MS)

USE THIS IF MS IS BROKEN AFTER UPDATING SYSTEM

!!  If you have already installed MS and are installing a newer version, you will more than likely need to do:

ms save reset

This will reset your settings to the default for MS to work properly with an upgraded system. Make sure to redo your settings. If you would like to see a copy of your settings, simply do:

lua ms.save

Before doing ms save reset and this will list all your settings so you can reference it afterwards.

Open up the package module installer

Make sure that you have it clear of any other packages other than custom packages you made yourself.

Install Mathiaus_System.trigger or MS_v(<current-version).trigger file from archives. Ex: MS_v3.0.trigger

Once installed, close down mudlet, and restart.

Things to remember: Make sure that you have GMCP enabled in settings, as well as config gmcpVitalsAdvanced in game

Autosave on exit as well, same page
On the Mapper tab, Download and Save the current map

Using ms or ms help will bring up the commands to use for the system.

Use ms setup to get started.
It will ask you a series of questions. First one will be about defenses.
Using ms def will list the current defenses you’re using for your class, and you can toggle the defense on or off by doing ms def <def_name>.

Once you’re satisfied, type continue and hit enter.
The next step is to set your affliction call clan, which you either set with the tag name or the shortcode call of clt<number> where you have your clan placed in the list.

Next it will ask if you have the skill quickdraw in weaponry. 

Next it will ask if you have the skill Parry in weaponry.

Next it will ask if you have the skill Kipup

Next it will ask if you have Trueassess in perception

In ms combat, you can set up your weapon id’s in this section:

Once that’s done, type finish and hit enter.
That’s it! You’re all done with the setup. I recommend highly going through ms allies and also checking out your class functions as well once you’re done.
 
The UI can be adjusted with ms ui and ms fs, as well as ms window 1920 or ms window 1600
